`flydrive` is a framework-agnostic package which provides a powerful wrapper to manage file Storage in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

There are currently 3 drivers available:

- `'local'`: Stores files on the local file system.
- `'s3'`: Amazon S3 and other compatible services
  - You need to install the `@slynova/flydrive-s3` package to be able to use this driver.
  - This driver is compatible with DigitalOcean Spaces and Scaleway Object Storage.
- `'gcs'`: Google Cloud Storage
  - You need to install the `@slynova/flydrive-gcs` package to be able to use this driver.

---

## Getting Started

This package is available in the npm registry.
It can easily be installed with `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
$ npm i @slynova/flydrive
# or
$ yarn add @slynova/flydrive
```

When you require the package in your file, it will give you access to the `StorageManager` class.
This class is a facade for the package and should be instantiated with a [configuration object](https://github.com/Slynova-Org/flydrive/blob/develop/examples/config.ts).

```javascript
const { StorageManager } = require('@slynova/flydrive');
const storage = new StorageManager(...);
```

Once you instantiated the manager, you can use the `StorageManager#disk()` method to retrieve a disk an use it.

```javascript
storage.disk(); // Returns the default disk (specified in the config)
storage.disk('awsCloud'); // Returns the driver for the disk "s3"
storage.disk('awsCloud', customConfig); // Overwrite the default configuration of the disk
```

## Registering External Driver

After installing any external driver, like `@slynova/flydrive-gcs`, you need to register it inside our manager to be able to use it.

The following is done by using the method `storage.registerDriver(name: string, Driver)`.

```ts
const { GoogleCloudStorage } = require('@slynova/flydrive-gcs');
const { StorageManager } = require('@slynova/flydrive');
const storage = new StorageManager(...);

storage.registerDriver('gcs', GoogleCloudStorage);
```

## Driver's API

Each driver extends the abstract class [`Storage`](https://github.com/Slynova-Org/flydrive/blob/develop/packages/flydrive/src/Storage.ts). This class will throw an exception for each methods by default. The driver needs to overwrite the methods it supports.

The following method doesn't exist on the `LocalFileSystemStorage` driver, therefore, it will throw an exception.

```javascript
// throws "E_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED: Method getSignedUrl is not supported for the driver LocalFileSystemStorage"
storage.disk('local').getSignedUrl();
```

Since we are using TypeScript, you can make use of casting to get the real interface:

```typescript
import { LocalFileSystemStorage } from '@slynova/flydrive';

storage.disk<LocalFileSystemStorage>('local');
```

### Response interface

Asynchronous methods will always return a Promise which resolves with a `Response`
object. The response object may contain relevant data in its properties (for
example, the `ExistsResponse` object for the `exists` method contains a boolean
`exists` property).

All responses additionally have a `raw` property which is driver-specific and
contains the result from the original call made by the driver.

### Exceptions

In case of runtime errors, `flydrive` will try to throw driver-agnostic exceptions.
Exceptions also have a `raw` property which contains the original error.

### Methods

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><code>append(location: string, content: Buffer | Stream | string, options: object): Promise&lt;Response&gt;</code></summary>

This method will append the content to the file at the location.
If the file doesn't exist yet, it will be created.

```javascript
// Supported drivers: "local"

await storage.disk('local').append('foo.txt', 'bar');
// foo.txt now has the content `${initialContent}bar`
```

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><code>copy(src: string, dest: string, options: object): Promise&lt;Response&gt;</code></summary>

This method will copy a file to another location.

```javascript
// Supported drivers: "local", "s3", "gcs"

await storage.disk('local').copy('foo.txt', 'bar.txt');
// foo.txt was copied to bar.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><code>delete(location: string): Promise&lt;DeleteResponse&gt;</code></summary>

This method will delete the file at the given location.

```javascript
// Supported drivers: "local", "s3", "gcs"

const { wasDeleted } = await storage.disk('local').delete('foo.txt');
// If a file named foo.txt has been deleted, wasDeleted is true.
```

The value returned by this method will have a `wasDeleted` property that
can be either a boolean (`true` if a file was deleted, `false` if there was
no file to delete) or `null` (if no information about the file is available).

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><code>driver()</code></summary>

This method returns the driver used if you need to do anything specific not supported by default.

```javascript
storage.disk('local').driver(); // Returns the "fs-extra" module.

storage.disk('googleCloud').driver(); // Returns an instance of the the Google Cloud Storage client.
